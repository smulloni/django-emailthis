a simple email-to-a-friend application that generates an email
form, handles its submission, persists the submission data to a
database, and sends a templated email.  Both anonymous and registered
users can send email.
"""

This app started out as a quasi-fork of Jeff Croft's "mailfriend" app
(http://code.google.com/p/django-mailfriend/), but the latter only
supported registered users; this supports users of both
the registered and unregistered varieties.

Form submission is here done solely via ajax; form loading is intended
to be handled similarly.
