	* emailthis/views.py: patch from Daniel Benamy, changing the default From email to DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL rather than the user-supplied 
	email.  The old behavior can be turned on with the boolean EMAILTHIS_SEND_FROM_USER setting.

	* pep8 cleanup; add max_length to form fields

	* emailthis/views.py (process_email_form): deal properly with the case in which get_absolute_url() returns a full url.
